# Visualization

## Introduction {#vis-intro-intro}

(Example: Use side-by-side boxplots to compare two groups, then use two-
sample t-tests on the same data)  Use histograms to investigate shape, and then later in the 
course to verify conditions for hypothesis tests.  

This next section uses a blood storage dataset from a study of prostate cancer
recurrence. This dataset was contributed by Dr. Amy Nowacki, Associate 
Professor, Cleveland Clinic. This dataset is one of many from the 
[`medicaldata` R package](https://higgi13425.github.io/medicaldata/),
curated by Dr. Peter Higgins, M.D. at the
[University of Michigan Medical School](http://www.med.umich.edu/higginslab/).
More information about the blood storage data is available at the 
[TSHS Resources Portal](https://www.causeweb.org/tshs/blood-storage/). A brief
description of the study follows.

> [A retrospective cohort study of] 316 men who had undergone radical 
> prostatectomy and received tranfusion during or within 30 days of the surgical 
> procedure and had available prostate specific antigen (PSA) follow-up data.
> The outcome [of interest] was time to biochemical cancer recurrence.
> The study evaluated the association between red blood cells (RBC) storage 
> duration and biochemical prostate cancer recurrence after radical 
> prostatectomy. Specifically tested was the hypothesis that perioperative 
> transfusion of allogeneic RBCs stored for a prolonged period is associated 
> with earlier biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after prostatectomy.

To get started, install the `medicaldata` package and load the library. 

```{r install-package, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("medicaldata")
library(medicaldata)
```

Now access the `blood` dataset within this package. 

```{r readbloodstorage, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
blood <- medicaldata::blood
head(blood) # use head to look at the first 6 rows
```

```{r}
class(blood)
```

```{r}
# get just the column names for a dataset
names(blood)
```

## Data Types

While exploring a dataset, you want to know what each variable's role in the 
analysis will be.

- What is the variable (i.e., column) of interest?
  - response, dependent, y, outcome
- which are your predictor variables?
  - predictor, independent variable, x

For each variable, you want to know what possible values it can take on.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\"Continuous Discrete\" by Allison Horst."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/other-stats-artwork/continuous_discrete.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\"Nominal Ordinal Binary\" by Allison Horst."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/other-stats-artwork/nominal_ordinal_binary.png")
```

The type of information a variable holds will dictate the summary statistics you 
can make, the visualizations you can create, and the models you can fit.

Ordinal and discrete variables should be converted into `factor` variables in R.
A `factor` is R's way of naming a **categorical** variable.
This is different from a **character string**, e.g., a person's name.

The outcome of interest is the recurrence of cancer (no = 0 or yes = 1).

In cancer studies and other kinds of studies that measure time to an event such 
as cancer recurrence, survival analysis is employed. Read more about how to do
this in Clark TG, Bradburn MJ, Love SB, Altman DG. Survival analysis part I: 
basic concepts and first analyses. British journal of cancer. 2003 Jul;89(2):232-8. https://www.nature.com/articles/6601118

Summarize the number of cancer recurrences and non-recurrences as a recurrence
frequency.

```{r}
recurrence_freq <- blood %>%
  group_by(Recurrence) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
recurrence_freq
```

This data dictionary describes each variable in the dataset.

To visualize data we will use a grammar of graphics. We build up a visualization
from component parts starting with the data. We can then layer other parts on
top of this data.

## Grammar of Graphics

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The idea behind the grammar of graphics is to decompose graphics into its constitudent layers: data, mapping, statistics, scales, geometries, facets, coordinates, and theme. by Thomas Lin Pedersen."}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/ggplot-grammar_layers.png")
```

## Data + geometries

```{r}
# add a data layer
ggplot(data = blood)
```

```{r}
# add a data later with an asthetic mapping
ggplot(data = blood, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence))
```


```{r}
# add a geometry layer
# by default the stat layer for geom_bar will count values
ggplot(data =  blood, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence)) + geom_bar()
```

If we have a pre-calculated set of values, we want to tell `geom_bar` to use the `"identity"` statistic.

```{r}
recurrence_freq
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = recurrence_freq, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Something to think about: we have highly unbalanced classes.
This might be something to think about when you fit models and only look at blind performance metrics

100 patients, 99 healthy, 1 sick. If my model classifies healthy *every time*.
It's still 99% correct.

### Layer values

If a value does not exist in a particular layer,
ggplot will try to use data from the previous layer

```{r}
# everything in the base layer
ggplot(data = recurrence_freq, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

```{r}
# move astetic mapping to geom layer
ggplot(data = recurrence_freq) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Recurrence, y = count), stat = "identity")
```

```{r}
# move data to geom layer
ggplot() +
  geom_bar(data = recurrence_freq, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence, y = count), stat = "identity")
```

This means we can add more layers with different data sets if we want to.

## Geometries

### Univariate

#### Continuous

```{r}
ggplot(blood, aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(blood, aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

### Bivariate

The `TVol` column represents the Tumor volume as an ordinal variable

- 1 = Low
- 2 = Medium
- 3 = Extensive

However, the way it is encoded in the dataset is as a (discrete) numeric variable,
even though it actually represents a categorical variable.
To convert the numeric column (or any column) into a categorical **factor** we can use the `as.factor` function.

```{r}
# Does not show TVol properly
ggplot(blood) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = TVol, y = Age))
```

```{r}
# please a box plot for each value of TVol as a factor
ggplot(blood) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age))
```

We can also use a violin plot, to better show the distribution of the dataset,
instead of using a boxplot.

And we can also overlay a different geometry on top.

```{r}
ggplot(blood) + 
  geom_violin(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age))
```

```{r}
ggplot(blood) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age))
```

We can move around our data layers to save some typing,
and have the geometry layer use the same data and mapping layer.

```{r}
ggplot(blood, aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter()
```

## Other Aesthetic mappings

We can also set other aesthetic mappings, e.g., color

- `PVol`: Prostate volume in grams (g)
- `PreopPSA`: Preoperative prostate specification antigen (PSA) in ng/mL
- `sGS`: Surgical Gleason score
  - 1 = Not assigned
  - 2 = No residual disease or score 0-6
  - 3 = Score 7
  - 4 = Score 8-10

```{r}
ggplot(blood) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = sGS))
```

Again, we have a numeric variable that is really an ordinal categorical variable

```{r}
ggplot(blood) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = as.factor(sGS)))
```


## Facets

Facets allow us to re-plot the same figure by separate groups.
Think of this as the `group_by` version for plotting.


```{r}
# use facet wrap for a single variable
ggplot(blood) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = as.factor(sGS))) +
  facet_wrap(~ RBC.Age.Group)
```

```{r}
# use facet grid for 2 variables
ggplot(blood) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = as.factor(FamHx))) +
  facet_grid(RBC.Age.Group ~ Recurrence)
```

## Themes

```{r}
g <- ggplot(blood) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = as.factor(FamHx))) +
  facet_grid(RBC.Age.Group ~ Recurrence)
g
```

```{r}
g + theme_minimal()
```

Using ggthemes

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
g + theme_wsj()
```

```{r}
g + theme_fivethirtyeight()
```


```{r}
g + theme_excel()
```

```{r readcmvdata, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cytomegalovirus <- read_csv("../data/cytomegalovirus.csv")
```
