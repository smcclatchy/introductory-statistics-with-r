[Blood storage dataset description](https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/blob/master/description_docs/blood_storage_desc.pdf)

> [A retrospective cohort study of] 316 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy and recieved tranfusion during or within 30 days of the surgical prodedure
> and had available PSA follow-up data.
> The outcome [of interest] was time to biochemical cancer recurrence.
> Study evaluated the association between red blood cells storage duration and biochemical prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.
> Specifically, tested was the hypothesis that perioperative transfution of allogenetic RBCs stored for a prolonged period is associated with earlier biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after prostatectomy.

Download the blood storage data by [clicking the **Download** button here](https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/blob/master/data/blood_storage.rda). This will load the data directly into RStudio. Check your Environment tab at upper right to see a new data object called `blood_storage`.

```{r}
head(blood_storage) # use head to look at the first 6 rows
```

```{r}
class(blood_storage)
```


```{r}
# get just the column names for a dataset
names(blood_storage)
```


## Data Types

While exploring a dataset, you want to know what each variable's role in the analysis will be.

- What is the variable (i.e., column) of interest?
  - response, dependent, y, outcome
- which are your predictor variables?
  - predictor, independent variable, x

For each variable, you want to know what possible values it can take on.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\"Continuous Discrete\" by Allison Horst."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/other-stats-artwork/continuous_discrete.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\"Nominal Ordinal Binary\" by Allison Horst."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/other-stats-artwork/nominal_ordinal_binary.png")
```


The type of information a variable holds will dictate the summary statistics you can make,
the visualizations you can create,
and the models you can fit.

Ordinal and discrete variables should be converted into `factor` variables in R.
A `factor` is R's way of naming a **categorical** variable.
This is different from a **character string**, e.g., a person's name.

```{r}
recurrence_freq <- blood_storage %>%
  group_by(Recurrence) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
recurrence_freq
```

## Grammar of Graphics

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The idea behind the grammar of graphics is to decompose graphics into its constitudent layers: data, mapping, statistics, scales, geometries, facets, coordinates, and theme. by Thomas Lin Pedersen."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/ggplot2/ggplot-grammar_layers.png")
```

## Data + geometries

```{r}
# add a data layer
ggplot(data = blood_storage)
```

```{r}
# add a data later with an asthetic mapping
ggplot(data = blood_storage, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence))
```


```{r}
# add a geometry layer
# by default the stat layer for geom_bar will count values
ggplot(data =  blood_storage, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence)) + geom_bar()
```

If we have a pre-calculated set of values, we want to tell `geom_bar` to use the `"identity"` statistic.

```{r}
recurrence_freq
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = recurrence_freq, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Something to think about: we have highly unbalanced classes.
This might be something to think about when you fit models and only look at blind performance metrics

100 patients, 99 healthy, 1 sick. If my model classifies healthy *every time*.
It's still 99% correct.

### Layer values

If a value does not exist in a particular layer,
ggplot will try to use data from the previous layer

```{r}
# everything in the base layer
ggplot(data = recurrence_freq, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

```{r}
# move astetic mapping to geom layer
ggplot(data = recurrence_freq) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Recurrence, y = count), stat = "identity")
```

```{r}
# move data to geom layer
ggplot() +
  geom_bar(data = recurrence_freq, mapping = aes(x = Recurrence, y = count), stat = "identity")
```

This means we can add more layers with different data sets if we want to.

## Geometries

### Univariate

#### Continuous

```{r}
ggplot(blood_storage, aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(blood_storage, aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

### Bivariate

The `TVol` column represents the Tumor volume as an ordinal variable

- 1 = Low
- 2 = Medium
- 3 = Extensive

However, the way it is encoded in the dataset is as a (discrete) numeric variable,
even though it actually represents a categorical variable.
To convert the numeric column (or any column) into a categorical **factor** we can use the `as.factor` function.

```{r}
# Does not show TVol properly
ggplot(blood_storage) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = TVol, y = Age))
```

```{r}
# please a box plot for each value of TVol as a factor
ggplot(blood_storage) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age))
```

We can also use a violin plot, to better show the distribution of the dataset,
instead of using a boxplot.

And we can also overlay a different geometry on top.

```{r}
ggplot(blood_storage) + 
  geom_violin(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age))
```

```{r}
ggplot(blood_storage) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age))
```

We can move around our data layers to save some typing,
and have the geometry layer use the same data and mapping layer.

```{r}
ggplot(blood_storage, aes(x = as.factor(TVol), y = Age)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter()
```

## Other Astetic mappings

We can also set other asthetic mappings, e.g., color

- `PVol`: Prostate volume in grams (g)
- `PreopPSA`: Preoperative prostate specification antigen (PSA) in ng/mL
- `sGS`: Surgical Gleason score
  - 1 = Not assigned
  - 2 = No residual disease or score 0-6
  - 3 = Score 7
  - 4 = Score 8-10

```{r}
ggplot(blood_storage) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = sGS))
```

Again, we have a numeric variable that is really an ordinal categorical variable

```{r}
ggplot(blood_storage) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = as.factor(sGS)))
```


## Facets

Facets allow us to re-plot the same figure by separate groups.
Think of this as the `group_by` version for plotting.


```{r}
# use facet wrap for a single variable
ggplot(blood_storage) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = as.factor(sGS))) +
  facet_wrap(~ RBC.Age.Group)
```

```{r}
# use facet grid for 2 variables
ggplot(blood_storage) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = as.factor(FamHx))) +
  facet_grid(RBC.Age.Group ~ Recurrence)
```

## Themes

```{r}
g <- ggplot(blood_storage) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PVol, y = PreopPSA, color = as.factor(FamHx))) +
  facet_grid(RBC.Age.Group ~ Recurrence)
g
```

```{r}
g + theme_minimal()
```

Using ggthemes

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
g + theme_wsj()
```

```{r}
g + theme_fivethirtyeight()
```


```{r}
g + theme_excel()
```
