### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of tumor size (volume) in cubic centimeters:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  mutate(size_cubic_cm = Size / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  mutate(size_cubic_cm = Size / 1000,
         size_cubic_in = size_cubic_cm / 16)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few rows, you
can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work with non-**`dplyr`**
functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or `magrittr` package is loaded).

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  mutate(size_cubic_cm = Size / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the `summarize()` function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine*
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of the
`group_by()` function.


#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn't run off the
screen anymore. It's one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over data frame.

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  tail()
```

Here, we used `tail()` to look at the last six rows of our summary. Before, we had 
used `head()` to look at the first six rows. We can see that the `sex` column contains 
`NA` values because some animals had escaped before their sex and body weights 
could be determined. The resulting `mean_weight` column does not contain `NA` but 
`NaN` (which refers to "Not a Number") because `mean()` was called on a vector of 
`NA` values while at the same time setting `na.rm = TRUE`. To avoid this, we can 
remove the missing values for weight before we attempt to calculate the summary 
statistics on weight. Because the missing values are removed first, we can omit 
`na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Here, again, the output from these calls doesn't run off the screen
anymore. If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()` function
at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the number of rows to
display:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter species first:


```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(min_weight)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```


#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found
for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides
`count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for
each sex, we would do:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
    count(sex) 
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count()` is equivalent to:  

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarise(count = n())
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:  

```{r, purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE) 
```

Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of rows/observations 
for *one* factor (i.e., `sex`). 
If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, 
we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```{r purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  count(sex, species) 
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table 
according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. 
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of 
the levels of the species and (ii) in descending order of the count:

```{r purl = FALSE}
tumor %>%
  count(sex, species) %>%
  arrange(species, desc(n))
```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75 observations of 
the *albigula* species that are not specified for its sex (i.e. `NA`).
