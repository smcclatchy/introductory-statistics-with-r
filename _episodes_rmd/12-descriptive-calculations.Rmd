# Descriptive Calculations

## Building the pipeline

New script, clear your environment, re-load your libraries

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load the filtered data set created previously that contains days 0 or 13 only. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
tumor_subset <- read_csv("../data/tumor_filtered.csv")
```

Have a look at the data subset.

```{r}
tumor_subset
```

## Summary statistics
Descriptive statistics summarize and organize characteristics of a data set. The first step of statistical analysis is to describe characteristics of the responses, such as the average of one variable (e.g., age), or the relation between two variables (e.g., age and weight). Inferential statistics, the next step in an analysis, helps to determine whether data confirms or refutes your hypothesis and whether it is generalizable to a larger population. We focus on descriptive statistics here with some statistical summaries of the filtered data. `pull` extracts a single column of data in the same way the the `$` operator specifies a column. `pull` is a verb though, and reads more easily in piped operations like this one.

Filter out observations for day 0 only and look at the Size variable.

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  filter(Day == 0) %>%
  pull(Size)
```

The mean is one statistical summary showing the _central tendency_ of the data. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency, however, it is sensitive to _outliers_. Extreme values pull the mean toward them and have a disproportional effect on its value. The median value is another measure of central tendency as
well as a measure of _position_. This value lies directly in the center of the ordered data with half of the values above and half below it. It is not 
sensitive to extreme values - only its rank in the ordered values is considered.

Summarize tumor size for day 0 with the mean.

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  filter(Day == 0) %>%
  pull(Size) %>%
  mean()
```

Find mean tumor size for day 0 for group 1.

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  filter(Group == 1, Day == 0) %>%
  pull(Size) %>%
  mean()
```

Find mean tumor size for day 0 for group 2.

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  filter(Group == 2, Day == 0) %>%
  pull(Size) %>%
  mean()
```

Find mean tumor size for day 0 for group 3.

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  filter(Group == 3, Day == 0) %>%
  pull(Size) %>%
  mean()
```

Find mean tumor size for day 0 for group 4.

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  filter(Group == 4, Day == 0) %>%
  pull(Size) %>%
  mean()
```

What are the unique group numbers?

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  pull(Group) %>%
  unique()
```

## Groupby operations
Use `group_by` and `summarize` to view group means for all groups.

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  filter(Day == 0) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarize(avg_size = mean(Size))
```

Mean and median both summarize the center of the data. Median lies directly at 
center of the ordered data values - it lies at the midpoint of these values and
is a measure of position. 
The _quantile_ defines a specific part of a data set above or below some limit. 
For example, quartiles divide a data set into fourths, and percentiles by 
100ths. The median is the 50th percentile of the data - half lie above this 
value and half below.
_Standard deviation_ measures the spread of the data. This summary statistic
measures the degree of _dispersion_ or _variability_ of the data.  
`quantile` takes an argument `probs` that gives the probability of values falling beneath a specific quantile. For example, `probs = .25` means that 25% of the values will be less than this quantile. This is the first quarter, or quartile, of the data.

```{r}
tumor_subset %>%
  group_by(Group, Day) %>%
  summarize(avg_size = mean(Size),
            sd_size = sd(Size),
            q1 = quantile(Size, probs = .25)
            )
```
