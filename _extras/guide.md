This lesson's goals are informed by the 
(American Statistical Association Guidelines for Assessment and Instructions in Statistics)[https://www.amstat.org/asa/education/Guidelines-for-Assessment-and-Instruction-in-Statistics-Education-Reports.aspx]. Specifically, goals 3 and 8 from the (2016 College Report)[https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/GAISE/GaiseCollege_Full.pdf] guide lesson development and content.

Goal 3: Students should be able to produce graphical displays and numerical summaries and 
interpret what these do and do not reveal. 
Goal 8: Students should be able to interpret and draw conclusions from standard output from 
statistical software. 

The lesson is appropriate for those with no programming background and no more statistics background than they would have learned in secondary school (e.g. mean, median, histograms). 
The focus here is on basic data analysis skills and statistical thinking. More advanced programming and statistics topics are left to subsequent courses to address.
