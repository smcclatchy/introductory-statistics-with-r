This lesson introduces the R statistical programming language with a goal to promote efficient and reproducible data analyses. You will learn how to code in R while reviewing basic statistical concepts including numerical summaries (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation) and graphical displays of biomedical data. This lesson borrows from [Data Science for the Biomedical Sciences](https://github.com/chendaniely/ds4biomed) (Chen & Brown, 2021) and [Data Carpentry Ecology R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).
