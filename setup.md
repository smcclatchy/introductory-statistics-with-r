## Installation

R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use RStudio. 

1. Install the latest version of R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Install the latest version of RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Choose the free RStudio Desktop version for Windows, Mac, or Linux. 
3. Start RStudio by double-clicking the icon. 
4. Click on the Packages tab located at lower right.
5. Click **Install** and type `tidyverse`, which is the name of the R package you want to install for this course.
