## Loading data into R

Loading data into R is the first step!

First we need to load up a package to make loading data sets easier.
We will be using the `tidyverse` set of packages for all of our data processing needs in R.
^[This is not the only way you can process data in R, but from experience, it seems to be the easier way to learn R due to its consistency, community, and learning materials.]

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/master/rstats-artwork/tidyverse_celestial.png" title="&quot;Tidyverse Celestial&quot; by Allison Horst. &quot;tidyverse&quot; hex sticker in space surrounded by other tidyverse package hex logos." alt="&quot;Tidyverse Celestial&quot; by Allison Horst. &quot;tidyverse&quot; hex sticker in space surrounded by other tidyverse package hex logos." style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We first will load up the `tidyverse` packages using the `library` function.


~~~
library(tidyverse)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
── Attaching packages ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
✔ ggplot2 3.3.3     ✔ purrr   0.3.4
✔ tibble  3.1.0     ✔ dplyr   1.0.5
✔ tidyr   1.1.3     ✔ stringr 1.4.0
✔ readr   1.4.0     ✔ forcats 0.5.1
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
~~~
{: .output}

The first time you load up the `tidyverse` library,
there will be some output that lists the packages `tidyverse` loads,
along with any functions that share the same name as other functions (i.e., conflicts).
As long as you are mindful about starting a new RStudio session before you work,
you can ignore this output for now.

Now we can use all the functions within the Tidyverse to do our data processing.
If you are following along and you run a piece of code and end up with an `could not find function` error,
make sure you typed `library(tidyverse)` correctly and executed the line of code.

## Find your files

Let the below figures represent a `ds4biomed` folder on your Desktop on Windows and Mac, respectively.

:::{.row}
:::{.column}
```
C:\
  |- Users\
    |- Daniel\
      |- Desktop\
        |- ds4biomed\
         |- data\
         |    |- medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv
         |- output\
         |- 01-load_data.R
         |- README.md
         |- ds4biomed.Rproj
```
:::

:::{.column}
```
/
  |- Users/
    |- Daniel/
      |- Desktop/
        |- ds4biomed/
          |- data/
          |    |- medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv
          |- output/
          |- 01-load_data.R
          |- README.md
          |- ds4biomed.Rproj
```
:::
:::

Suppose we are "in" the `ds4biomed` folder,
where we can see the `data` and `output` folders
along with the
`01-load_data.R`, `README.md`, and `ds4biomed.Rproj` files.

We can reference our `medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv` file inside the `data` folder as: `data/medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv`.
That is, we can use the backslash, `/` to move into folders.
We can write `data/medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv` because we are "starting from" the `ds4biomed` folder.
This is called a **relative path** because the location of the `csv` file is relative to the `ds4biomed` starting point (aka **working directory**).
If we want to refer to any arbitrary filer or folder on the computer, we can specify the **full path** of the file.
The full path will start with a drive letter on windows,
`C:\Users\Daniel\Desktop\ds4biomed\data\medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv`,
and a `/` on a Mac,
`/Users/Daniel/Desktop/ds4biomed/data/medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv`.

Suppose we create an `analysis` folder for our `01-load_data.R` script so that our folder structure looks like this
(only the mac version is shown in the example below):

```
/
  |- Users/
    |- Daniel/
      |- Desktop/
        |- ds4biomed/
          |- data/
          |    |- medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv
          |- output/
          |- analysis
          |    |- 01-load_data.R
          |- README.md
          |- ds4biomed.Rproj
```

Now, if our **working directory** is now in the `analysis` folder,
we need a way to reference one folder up to the `ds4biomed` folder *and then* back down to the `data` folder.
The way we can **relatively** reference the previous folder is with 2 dots, `..`, `../data/medicaldata_tumorgrowth.csv`

```
/
  |- Users/
    |- Daniel/
      |- projects/
        |-chart_review/
        |    |- data/
        |    |    |- patients.csv
        |    |- analysis/
        |         |- demographics.R # you are working here
        |- rct_m22-0305
             |- data/
                  |- patients.csv
```

> ## Exercise 1 
> 
> Refer to the example folder structure above where we have a `chart_review` and `rct_m22-0305` folder in our `projects` folder.
> Let's say we are currently in the `chart_review/analysis` folder, working on our `demographics.R` as denoted by the `#`.
> 1. Write the **relative path** to the `patients.csv` file in the `rct_m22-0305` folder.
> 2. Write the **absolute path** to the `patients.csv` file in the `chart_review` folder.

### Paths in Windows

When you are looking at file paths in the Windows Explorer,
you will notice that all Windows paths will use the backslash, `\`,
instead of the forward slash, `/` to refer to files.
In a lot of programming languages, including R, the `\` is a special character,
so if you want to use `\` for file paths in Windows, you will have to use 2 backslashes, e.g., `..\\data\\patients.csv\\`.
However, you can still use the regular `/` in Windows to refer to folders just like other **operating systems**.

## Set your working directory

So far, we have been talking about a "starting point" or "working directory",
when we have been referring to files around our computer.
In order to quickly and reliably set your working directory,
we use **RStudio Projects** (Section \@ref(rstudio-projects)).


## Reading text files (CSV)

Now that we know how to find our files, let's load up our first data set.
When trying to type in a file path,
you can hit the `<TAB>` key to autocomplete the files.
This will help you with a lot of potential spelling mistakes.

This dataset comes from the [`medicaldata` R package](https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata),
curated by Dr. Peter Higgins, M.D. in the
[IBD Research Group at the University of Michigan Medical School](http://www.med.umich.edu/higginslab/).

The dataset we loaded is a modified version of the "tumorgrowth" dataset in the `medicaldata` package.
It shows the treatment group for a particular sample and its size ($mm^3$) over time (days).

> Cells from a human glioma cell line were implanted in the flank of n=37 nude mice and a subcutaneous tumor (xenograft) was allowed to grow.
> When a tumor grew to around 40-60mm^3, the animal was assigned to one of 4 experimenal groups...
> The main outcome in xenograft experiments is the size (volume) of the tumor over time.

You can read more about the dataset and study in the codebook for
["Mixed-Effects Modeling of Tumor Growth in Animal Xenograft Experiments"](https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/blob/master/description_docs/tumorgrowth_desc.pdf)


**Debug help:**
- If the above code returns a `could not find function "read_csv"`
  make sure you have loaded up the proper library with `library(tidyverse)`
- If the above code returns a `does not exist in current working directory`,
  make sure the working directory it lists is your expected "starting point" (i.e., working directory),
  and make sure the file path is spelled correctly.

`read_csv` will show us the columns that were read in,
as well as the **data type** of that column (e.g., character, double -- a number).

Loading a data set is great, but we need a convenient way to refer to the data set.
We don't want to re-load the data set every time we want to perform an action on it.
We can take this loaded data set and **assign** it to a **variable**.
We can do this with the **assignment** **operator**, `<-`.
Note the way it is typed, a less than symbol (`<`) followed immediately by the dash (`-`) without any spaces in between.
The right side of the assignment operator, `<-`, will be executed and then **assigned** to the variable on the left.

Notice this time we no longer see the dataset being printed.
The "Environment" tab in the RStudio panel will now have an entry for the variable you used.
Clicking on the right data set icon will open a view of your dataset,
clicking on the arrow will show you the column-by-column text representation (technically it's called the `structure`).

To look at our dataset we can execute *just* the variable we assigned the dataset to.

This tabular dataset that has now been loaded into R is called a **data frame** **object** (or simply **dataframe**),
the `tidyverse` uses a `tibble`.
For the most part, a `data.frame` object will behave like a `tibble` object.

## What are data frames?

When we loaded the data into R, it got stored as an object of class `tibble`, 
which is a special kind of data frame (the difference is not important for our 
purposes, but you can learn more about tibbles 
[here](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)). 
Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for most tabular data, and what we
use for statistics and plotting.
Data frames can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by
functions like `read_csv()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive or the web.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are
vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

We can see this also when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

## Inspecting data frames

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

* Size:
    * `dim(tumor)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
          and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
          the object)
    * `nrow(tumor)` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol(tumor)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
    * `head(tumor)` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail(tumor)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
    * `names(tumor)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	   objects)
    * `rownames(tumor)` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str(tumor)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
	   content of  each column
    * `summary(tumor)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.

## Indexing and subsetting data frames



Our data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note
that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with
different classes.


~~~
# We can extract specific values by specifying row and column indices
# in the format: 
# data_frame[row_index, column_index]
# For instance, to extract the first row and column from surveys:
tumor[1, 1]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  Grp  
  <chr>
1 1.CTR
~~~

~~~
# First row, sixth column:
tumor[1, 6]   
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error: Can't subset columns that don't exist.
✖ Location 6 doesn't exist.
ℹ There are only 5 columns.
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
# We can also use shortcuts to select a number of rows or columns at once
# To select all columns, leave the column index blank
# For instance, to select all columns for the first row:
tumor[1, ]
~~~
{: .language-r}

# A tibble: 1 x 5
  Grp   Group    ID   Day  Size

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:


~~~
tumor[, -1]                 # The whole data frame, except the first column
~~~
{: .language-r}

Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:


~~~
# As before, using single brackets returns a data frame:
tumor["Size"]
tumor[, "Size"]
# Double brackets returns a vector:
tumor[["Size"]]
# We can also use the $ operator with column names instead of double brackets
# This returns a vector:
tumor$Size
~~~
{: .language-r}

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.

> ### Exercise
>
> 1. Create a `data.frame` (`tumors_200`) containing only the data in
>    row 200 of the `tumor` dataset.
>
> 2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?
>
>      * Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
>      * Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make
>        sure it's meeting expectations.
>      * Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
>      * Create a new data frame (`tumors_last`) from that last row.
>
> 3. Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data
>    frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `tumors_middle`.
>
> 4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
>    `head(tumor)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys
>    dataset.
>    
> > ## Solution

> > ~~~
> > 1. tumors_200 <- tumor[200, ]
