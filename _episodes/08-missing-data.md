## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented
in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. This feature
makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result as if the missing
values were removed (`rm` stands for ReMoved) first.


~~~
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
max(heights)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 4
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.


Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

> ### Challenge
>
> 1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.
>
>     ```r
>     heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
>     ```
> 2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.
>
> 3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.
