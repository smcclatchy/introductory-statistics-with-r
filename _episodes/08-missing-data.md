## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented
in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. This feature
makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result as if the missing
values were removed (`rm` stands for ReMoved) first.


~~~
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
max(heights)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 4
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.


~~~
# Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2 4 4 6
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# Returns the object with incomplete cases removed. 
# The returned object is an atomic vector of type 
# `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
na.omit(heights)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2 4 4 6
attr(,"na.action")
[1] 4
attr(,"class")
[1] "omit"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# Extract those elements which are complete cases. 
# The returned object is an atomic vector of type 
# `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2 4 4 6
~~~
{: .output}

Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

> ## Exercise
>
> 1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.  
> 
> ~~~
> heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
>    
> 2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.  
>
> 3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.  
>
> > ## Solution
> >  1. ```{r}
> > heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)]    
> > # or  
> > heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)  
> > # or  
> > heights_no_na <- heights[complete.cases(heights)]
> > ```
> >     2. ```{r}
> > median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)  
> > ```
> >     3. ```{r}
> > heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]  
> > length(heights_above_67)
