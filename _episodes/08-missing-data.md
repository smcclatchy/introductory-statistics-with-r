## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented
in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. This feature
makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result as if the missing
values were removed (`rm` stands for ReMoved) first.


```r
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
max(heights)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 4
```

```r
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 6
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.



```r
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]
```

```
## [1] 2 4 4 6
```

```r
## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed. 
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
na.omit(heights)
```

```
## [1] 2 4 4 6
## attr(,"na.action")
## [1] 4
## attr(,"class")
## [1] "omit"
```

```r
## Extract those elements which are complete cases. 
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

```
## [1] 2 4 4 6
```
Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

> ### Challenge
>
> 1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.
>
>     ```r
>     heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
>     ```
> 2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.
>
> 3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.

> ```r
> heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
> 
> # 1.
> heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)] 
> # or
> heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)
> # or
> heights_no_na <- heights[complete.cases(heights)]
> 
> # 2.
> median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
> ```

> ## [1] 64
> ```
> 
> ```r
> # 3.
> heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]
> length(heights_above_67)
