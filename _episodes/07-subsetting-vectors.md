## Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:


```r
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
```

```
## [1] "rat"
```

```r
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

```
## [1] "dog" "rat"
```

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:


```r
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

```
## [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"   "rat"   "mouse" "cat"
```

R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start
counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do. Languages in the C
family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that's
simpler for computers to do.

### Conditional subsetting

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE` will
select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:


```r
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

```
## [1] 21 54 55
```

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of
other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the
values above 50:


```r
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
```

```
## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

```
## [1] 54 55
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):


```r
weight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g < 50]
```

```
## [1] 34 39
```

```r
weight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g == 55]
```

```
## [1] 21 55
```

```r
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

```
## numeric(0)
```

Here, `>` for "greater than", `<` stands for "less than", `<=` for "less than
or equal to", and `==` for "equal to". The double equal sign `==` is a test for
numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be
confused with the single `=` sign, which performs variable assignment (similar
to `<-`).

A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector.  One could use the
"or" operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly
become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to test if any of the elements of
a search vector are found:


```r
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat", "cat")

# return both rat and cat
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] 
```

```
## [1] "rat" "cat" "cat"
```

```r
# return a logical vector that is TRUE for the elements within animals
# that are found in the character vector and FALSE for those that are not
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat") 
```

```
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
# use the logical vector created by %in% to return elements from animals 
# that are found in the character vector
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")]
```

```
## [1] "rat" "dog" "cat" "cat"
```
